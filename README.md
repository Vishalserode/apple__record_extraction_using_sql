#Apple_record_extraction_using_sql

Queries and Analysis
The project includes SQL queries to answer various questions related to the Apple Store data, 
incorporating BETWEEN, LIKE, WHERE, UNION ALL, right join, left join, full join, extracting data, and subqueries:

-->Right join to find data from both tables where the condition is met in the right table.
-->Left join to retrieve all rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table.
--.>Full join to get all rows when there is a match in either the left or the right table.
-->Extracted data using subqueries to perform calculations or filter results.
-->Used BETWEEN to filter data within a specific range.
-->Utilized LIKE to perform pattern matching in text fields.
-->Applied WHERE clause for conditional filtering.
-->Combined CSV files using UNION ALL to consolidate data from multiple sources.
